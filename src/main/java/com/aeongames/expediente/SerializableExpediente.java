/**
 * the name "Expediente" is the best to use english does not seem to have a
 * great way to translate this concept for instance a medical record is not the
 * same a medical record might refer to a single entry on a book of medical
 * records an "Expediente" is not singular to "Medical" but is more general
 * information. and can apply to other scenarios. now for this PoC this will
 * apply a example in medical records however the idea is for this to be general
 * enough so can be used on other kinds of records.
 *
 * a possible translation COULD be portfolio refer to
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio
 *
 * TODO: add Listening or callbacks to Pool managers IF implemented.
 * TODO: GENERICS are missing
