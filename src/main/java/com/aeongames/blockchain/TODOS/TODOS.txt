List of TODOS or for future work after the POC:

/***************************#1**************************/
migrate the PBFT from 
the current implementation to something faster or at the least something more compact. 
also migrate the implementation as it is stands it requires REDIS for communications

we instead propouse to use: 
gRPC 
or Clain and clasic Sockets 
OR but not suggested HTTPS communications. <too verbose... > (convert data to strings) although the way we are working right now is the same.
also we might need to merge the PBFT with PAXOS Agreement. to also support authorization.

so add more javadocs. to clases and methods. 
/***************************#3**************************/


/***************************#4**************************/
i have some doubts on the Thread Safeness of some classes 
do more test on some of them to ensure they are thread safe or secure enought 
so to ensure multiple thread do not cause deadlocks/race/unexpected results. 
/***************************#4**************************/

/***************************#5**************************/
confirm the immutability of classes

/***************************#6**************************/
add better UI (if any at all)
